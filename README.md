These two programs are relatively the same, besides a few minor differences. The goal was to create a program that reads an input file containing baseball players' stats and computes their batting averages, slugging percentages, and on base percentages. 

The first program was created using Go. It read in the players and stored them in a list of player objects. Once the stats were calculated, the players were sorted by their slugging percentage and printed. This version accounted for any errors or missing fields in the text file being read from.

The second program was created using Julia. It functions very similarly to the first. However, it stored the players in a matrix. It calculated the stats and sorted them by slugging percentage, but also by name, and printed both results. This version did not require to account for any errors or missing fields in the text file.

Example text file "players.txt" included.
